Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
The process of designing, building, testing and maintaining software.Importance of it is that it helps to enable creation of software applications and systems which helps in powering aspects such as commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The Agile manifesto Manifesto and the Rise of Agile Development of  2001 which had a challenge in because it proved inflexible  and slow in responding to changing requirements 
The Object -Oriented Programming Revolution  which had challenge in managing and maintaining code became difficult
The Software Crisis and the Rise of Structured Programming which had challenges in failing to meet the requirements.
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements:You need to gather the requirements and documents the user needs for their system.
Design:You need to design and create a highly detailed designed of the software architecture and interface user.
Implementation:Write the code and build software according to the design given.
Testing:Conduct tests to ensure software meets quality needs and standards.
Demployment:Releae the  software to users or the customers.
Maintenance:Provide support,updates, and enhancements of the software.
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall:It is a sequential approach with distinct phases which flows down like a waterfall eg,requirements, design, implementation etc. 
While Agile is the iterative and incremental approach which is focused on flexibility, collaboration, and respondinf to changes.
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
The roles of a software developer is to  write codes and implement software solutions while a Quality Assurance Engineer ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Intergrated Development Environments  are software suites that provide  comprehensive tools for writing , debugging, and testing code such as Visual studio.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing requirements: Requirements may change during  the development cycle, which leads to project delays . The solution to that is we should continue to learn  the  new technologies through online, conferences and many more.
Tight deadlines makes the developer go into rush and leads to stress. The solution is  that they  should learn to negotiate realistic deadlines and expectation
Working in teams cna sometimes have communication challenges  and conflicts and the solution is effective communication and they should actively listen to to each other.
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing: Involves testing individual components or modules of software.
intergration testing:Involves testing interactions between different components.
System Testing: Testing the entire system as a whole.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the science of crafting effective  effective inputs to guide AI MODELS to bringdesired answers and outputs.Importance of it is that it improves accuracy and relevance by giving us the desired infomation and also clear instruction.
It helps in effecting communication which ensures AI understands your question and what you want.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
